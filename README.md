# My Frontend Path

Hello,

This is my very first article and I want to talk about my project studies except courses. When I am learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I started my journey with a Udemy course by Sadık Turan in my native language. After that course, I continued with various courses by Brad Traversy, FreeCodeCamp, Scrimba etc... But if you really want to be a good developer, you have to make a lot of practices besides curriculums. At this article, I want to demonstrate my works.

First, I will write name of project or website and used technologies and after that, I will share YouTube links with you.

When I doing this projects, I did watch and coding same time, first watch-try coding chapter by chapter.
